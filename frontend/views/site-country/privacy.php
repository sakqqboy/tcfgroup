        <p> Some of the cookies we use are necessary to enable you to move around the Website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas that may contain content for registered users.
            We also use functional cookies to record information about the choices you have made and to allow us to tailor the Website to our users; for example, to remember your language or region or that you have already completed a survey. This information is usually anonymized and is not used for any purpose unrelated to the Website.</p>
        <p> We or our service providers also use analytic services to help us understand how effective our content is, what interests our users have, and to improve how the Website works. In addition, we use web beacons, tracking pixels and similar services to understand more about the visitors to the Website, and to count visitor numbers and performance cookies to track how many individual users access the Website and how often. This information is used for statistical purposes and to improve how the Website works and it is not our intention to use such information to personally identify any user. However, if at any time you register and sign into the Website, we may combine such data with information from our web analytic services and cookies to analyze how you use the Website in more detail.</p>
        <p> The Website does not use targeting cookies to deliver targeted advertising on the Website; however, these cookies may be used on third party websites on which we occasionally advertise, to track the success of those advertising campaigns. We may use web beacons (also known as pixel tags) to determine which users have come to the Website after viewing an advertisement we have served on such third party websites. We also work with such third parties to collect data so that we can determine the effectiveness of our ads and serve ads targeted to your interests. The use of web beacons does not provide us with any personal information and we do not use this technology to access your personal information. It is used only to compile aggregated data about users who visit the Website and to gauge the effectiveness of our ads. Web beacons do not place information on your device, but may work in conjunction with cookies to monitor activity. You cannot remove or block web beacons, but you can remove or block cookies with which they work to block the collection of information about your user activity. Please see the Cookie Settings link for more detailed information on the cookies we use on the Website. The Cookie Settings link may be located in the page footer or via the menu bar or application settings.</p>
