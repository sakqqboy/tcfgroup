        Now that the average age of tax accountants is over 60 and the industry has completely matured (or declined), what kind of vision should we have and how should we change the industry? Before thinking about this, I think that there are things that companies must not change and things that must be changed. I would like to think first so as not to confuse the two.

        To contribute to society. To that end, we must continue to develop human resources. I believe this is the ultimate goal of any company. As a way to realize this, I think that a management philosophy, anagement philosophy, long-term vision, etc. will be created. Management principles and management philosophies change with the times, but I believe that continuing to contribute to society is the role of a company that will not change no matter what era comes. Conversely, it can be said that a company goes bankrupt because it no longer has a social mission, which is the reason for its existence.

        Companies must continue to change according to the trends of the times, such as medium- to long-term visions, strategies, and tactics. If you don't ride the "current", your company won't grow big. Because the times are opportunities for growth. However, chasing only the "fashion" will not continue to grow in the long term. Because it goes against the essence of management. Without confusing the two, we must formulate a long-term vision, a medium-term vision, and strategies to materialize them. </div>

    </div>
    <div class="col-6 Type-home-page-two">
        How much growth should be achieved is, in other words, the issue of the "appropriate size" of a company. In microeconomics, it is said that a company has an appropriate size (the size of the company that maximizes profits).However, if a company's purpose is to contribute to society, there should be no appropriate level of contribution. If there is, it is because the management has not found a way to contribute to society (this is called a growth opportunity).I am often asked ,"How far do you intend to grow the company?" To this question, I immediately answer, "Until the company goes bankrupt." The cause of the company's bankruptcy is the company's inability to contribute to society, in other words, the end of its social mission. Steering a company is like steering a ship: the bigger it gets, the more difficult it becomes. This is because it becomes difficult to respond to changes in the business environment. The bigger the ship, the more stable it looks, but the less it turns. Therefore, a small ship (company) is easier to maneuver and can respond quickly to environmental changes. Some managers consider the appropriate size of a company to be as long as they can steer it. However, if a company is a public institution, the scale of the company should be judged by the interests of society. Society expects us to make a greater contribution, so we must determine the size of our company from a social perspective. Therefore, as a company grows, it becomes less flexible and difficult to respond to social changes, and as a result, the risk of bankruptcy also increases. I believe that whether or not a company can dare to take that risk is the height of a manager's aspirations and sense of social mission. I want to be that kind of manager.
